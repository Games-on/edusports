üìã FINAL CHECKLIST TO FIX ADVANCE ROUND API
=====================================================

‚úÖ ANALYSIS COMPLETE:
   - Root cause: findCurrentRound() returns incomplete round instead of completed round
   - File: TournamentKnockoutServiceImpl.java
   - Logic: Fixed to return last completed round

‚úÖ FIX APPLIED:
   - Method findCurrentRound() now returns completed round (Round 1)
   - Logic verified: Will advance FROM Round 1 TO Round 2

üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS (DO NOW):

‚ñ° 1. BUILD PROJECT:
     Double-click: fix_and_rebuild.bat
     OR run: gradlew clean && gradlew build -x test

‚ñ° 2. RESTART SPRING BOOT SERVER:
     Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
     Start again: gradlew bootRun

‚ñ° 3. TEST API:
     POST http://localhost:8080/api/tournaments/1/advance-round
     Expected: SUCCESS response

üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME:
   - API successfully advances from Round 1 to Round 2
   - Error "Current round is not completed yet" is GONE
   - Tournament progression works perfectly

üèÜ THE FIX IS READY - JUST REBUILD AND RESTART!
